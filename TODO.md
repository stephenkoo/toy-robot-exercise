## Things to improve:
- The switch statements you use for parsing and execution of the commands both switch on the entries in the Command enum. Somewhat inflexible construct, adding new commands will require updating the enum as well as both switch statements. This means we have two functions with two switch statements that can potentially grow infinitely. This is in addition to having to modify several places in the first place. I would say the solution currently doesn't cater to adding new commands in an extensible way.
- An obvious change vector for this application is to add commands which have parsing behaviour that's different from existing commands (e.g. JUMP 3 - to jump 3 spaces in the facing direction, CHECK left - to see if space to the left is blocked). From what I can see the parsing behaviour of the application is not abstracted well enough to allow us to easily handle this. The only obvious solution given the implementation would be to create functions like `parseJumpCommandArguments`, you would hopefully agree this is not an entirely extensible way to handle this problem.
- There is no input source abstraction or input format abstraction for that matter. If we want alter the format or source of the input the application has no simple way to cater for this. There is also no output destination abstraction, so if we want to write output to a different place (e.g. file, network), the application does not easily cater for this. Overall even in a functional solution (or perhaps especially in a functional one) I like to see at least some level of dependency inversion. There is very limited dependency inversion in this solution.
- It's nice to constantize the table dimensions, but would have been even nicer to make it fully dynamic via some form of runtime configuration.
- Should not have all types to one file & push messages in the whole system to the boundary like you have, is less defensible (especially given that some are constructed via functions). The only reason it's at all tenable is due to the size of the application. Even in a functional solution a level of encapsulation is important, when working with the report command there is no good reason why I should have to worry about other files beyond the report action.
